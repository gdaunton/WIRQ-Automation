WIRQ-Automation
===============
WIRQ stands for West Irondequoit Radio Quality, it is the student run radio station at Irondequoit High School.
<br/>
<br/>
For AP computer science I created an automation program for the high school radio station. An automation program is a program that follows a setup rotation of defined groups of media files so that when a DJ is not at the mixer, the program can emulate the same music pattern that the DJ would follow. Although this program was not the most user friendly, once set up correctly it ran like a charm.
